canaryd
======

a mutli-site monitoring tool.

## Installation

```sh
$ go get github.com/tnorris/canary/cmd/canaryd
```

## Configuration

`canaryd` is configured via environment variables:

* `MANIFEST_URL` - ref to a JSON document describing what needs to be monitored
* `PUBLISHERS` - an explicit list of pubilshers to enable, defaulting to `stdout`
* `DEFAULT_MAX_TIMEOUT` - The max timeout value for any target. Actual timeout will be this value, or the interval if lower.
* `AUTO_RELOAD_INTERVAL` - The value (in seconds, as a floating point string) to query MANIFEST_URL for a potential manifest reload.See the Manifest reloading section for more information.
* `MAX_RELOAD_FAILURES` - The maximum number of allowed consecutive manifest reload failures combined with `AUTO_RELOAD_INTERVAL` (defaulting to 5). This parameter is specified as an integer and enables canaryd to handle if the `MANIFEST_URL` backend is temporarily unavailable. If a failure is caught before this threshold, then no changes are made to the currently executing manifest. If this threshold is reached, canaryd will exit with status 1 and an informational error about what caused the error. 
* `DEFAULT_SAMPLE_INTERVAL` - interval rate (in seconds) for targets without a defined interval value, defaults to 1 second.
* `RAMPUP_SENSORS` - When set to 'yes', configure a delayed start for each target sensors, with the delay based on an even division of DEFAULT_SAMPLE_INTERVAL by the target index. This assists with performance for large numbers of targets. This will cause all targets to be measured within one full DEFAULT_SAMPLE_INTERVAL when starting.

## Manifest

A manifest is a simple JSON document describing the sites to be monitored.  You must create such a document and host it somewhere so that it is accessible to `canaryd`.

Within the manifest, targets are defined as a json object with the required keys 'url' and 'name'. 'interval' is optional, and will define the interval rate in seconds to check the specific url, overriding the default interval settings in canaryd

An example manifest:

```js
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "url": "http://www.canary.io",
      "name": "canary"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://www.simple.com/",
      "name": "simple"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://www.heroku.com/",
      "name": "heroku"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://github.com",
      "name": "github",
      "interval": 60
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rampup sensors option

This ENV option allows each target to be started on an even division of the DEFAULT_SAMPLE_INTERVAL value. Executing with RAMPUP_SENSORS=yes on
a 4 second DEFAULT_SAMPLE_INTERVAL:

```sh
$ MANIFEST_URL=http://www.canary.io/manifest.json DEFAULT_SAMPLE_INTERVAL=4 RAMPUP_SENSORS=yes ./canaryd
2015-02-21T16:58:47-05:00 http://www.simple.com/ 301 71.189670 true

## Manifest reloading

`canaryd` supports manifest reloading via two means:

- SIGHUP - Canaryd queries the defined MANIFEST_URL and reloads for changes in the defined targets.
- Automatic reloading - `canaryd` will poll the MANIFEST_URL for changes via the interval defined in the AUTO_RELOAD_INTERVAL environment variable. This variable is a floating point value for the number of seconds that canaryd should poll for manifest changes, with 1, 15.0 and 0.25 all being valid. 

Manifest reloading in canary is done via the following process.
- If the MD5 hash of the manifest has not changed, do not trigger a reload operation.
- Within a reload operation:
    - Any target that is currently running that is not defined in the new manifest is stopped. Changes are detected via md5sum changes on all attributes of the target.
    - After stopping changed/removed target sensors, any target defined in the new manifest that does not have a running sensor is started.
    - Targets running with identical definitions in the old and new manifests are not changed, allowing sensor state to persist.

## Publishers

`canaryd` supports a number of configurable publishers.

### `stdout`

The default publisher.  Writes all measurements to `STDOUT` as they happen.

If `PUBLISHERS` are not set, this is activated by default.

To explicitly activate, set `PUBLISHERS=stdout`.

Example:

```sh
$ PUBLISHERS=stdout MANIFEST_URL=http://www.canary.io/manifest.json canaryd
2014/12/27 15:20:09 http://www.canary.io 200 128 true
2014/12/27 15:20:09 https://www.simple.com/ 200 252 true
2014/12/27 15:20:09 https://github.com 200 384 true
2014/12/27 15:20:09 https://www.heroku.com/ 200 413 true
2014/12/27 15:20:10 https://www.simple.com/ 200 76 true
2014/12/27 15:20:10 http://www.canary.io 200 94 true
2014/12/27 15:20:10 https://github.com 200 306 true
2014/12/27 15:20:10 https://www.heroku.com/ 200 306 true
^C
```

### `librato`

Writes all measurements to your [Librato](https://www.librato.com/) account at 5 second intervals.

To activate, set `PUBLISHERS=librato`.

For configuration purposes, the Librato publisher expects the following environment variables to bet set:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `LIBRATO_USER` | Yes | Librato API user |
| `LIBRATO_TOKEN` | Yes | Librato API token |
| `SOURCE` | No | source name to use in metrics, defaults to [`os.Hostname`](http://golang.org/pkg/os/#Hostname) |

The following metrics are produced:

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `canary.{NAME}.latency` | the time it took to complete the `GET` request |
| `canary.{NAME}.errors` | a count of samples that included an error |
| `canary.{NAME}.errors.http` | a count of samples that contained HTTP status codes outside of the 3xx range |
| `canary.{NAME}.errors.sampler` | a count of samples that indicated transport-level error such as a timeout or connection failure |

An example invocation:

```sh
$ PUBLISHERS=librato LIBRATO_USER=michael.gorsuch@gmail.com LIBRATO_TOKEN=REDACTED MANIFEST_URL=http://www.canary.io/manifest.json canaryd
#...
```
